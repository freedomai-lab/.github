## Welcome to OpenGVLab! 👋

We are a research group from Shanghai AI Lab focused on Vision-Centric AI research. The GV in our name, OpenGVLab, means general vision, a general understanding of vision, so little effort is needed to adapt to new vision-based tasks.

We develop model architecture and release pre-trained foundation models to the community to motivate further research in this area. We have made promising progress in general vision AI, with ***109 SOTA***🚀. In 2022, our open-sourced foundation model 65.5 mAP on the COCO object detection benchmark, 91.1% Top1 accuracy in Kinetics 400, achieved landmarks for AI vision👀 tasks for image🖼️ and video📹 understanding. In 2023, we created [VideoChat](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Ask-Anything)🦜,[llama-adapter](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/llama-adapter)🦙, 3D foundation model [Ponder V2](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/PonderV2)🧊 and many more wonderful works! In **CVPR 2023**, our vision foundation model [InternImage](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/internimage) was listed as one of the most influential papers, and by benefiting from our partner [OpenDriveLab](https://github.com/opendrivelab), we won the [Best paper](https://github.com/opendrivelab/UniAD) together🎉 . 

In **2024**, we released the **best open-source VLM** [InternVL](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/internvl) , video understanding foundation model [InternVideo2](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/internvideo), which won 7 Champions on [EgoVis challenges](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/EgoVideo) 🥇. Up to now, our brilliant team have open-sourced more than 70 works, please [find them here](https://github.com/orgs/OpenGVLab/repositories)😃

Based on solid vision foundations, we have expanded to Multi-Modality models and. We aim to empower individuals and businesses by offering a higher starting point for developing vision-based AI products and lessening the burden of building an AI model from scratch.
